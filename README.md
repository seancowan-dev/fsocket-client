This application allows users to host chat rooms and to share the URL of the room with their friends.  Once they are in the room they can paste Youtube URLs directly into the chat.  This will add the videos to a playlist which the room host can control.  When the room host plays a video, the video plays for all people in the room.  Its a quick and easy way to watch a video with a friend!

## Why This App Was Made

This app was made because due to the reduced amount of socialization we are all experiencing during the pandemic, I have found myself looking for ways to watch videos with my friends over the internet.  There are many offerings available on tap online, but this is my implementation.  I primarily watch Youtube with my friends and I found that many of the existing video-sharing applications were too verbose, there's too many features.  This application was developed so that anyone who is looking for a barebones, quick, and simple way to watch a Youtube video with a few friends can have that option available to them.

## API

https://damp-falls-21610.herokuapp.com/

This application uses a websocket based API implemented with [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) and as such as a non-traditional data flow.  There are no http endpoints in this application.  Socket.io operates on 'events' - named queries sent to the socket can respond with other named queries. This allows for highly specialized real-time content updates. This events operate using an 'emit' and 'on' syntax.  Events are emitted, and on reception of those events, other actions can be taken.

## Summary of Socket.io Endpoints

Socket.io endpoints must live in the application root in order to operate correctly.

The Client Callback Event is the event which is sent by the client (if any) when the server responds to the initial action.  If this column is shown as 'none' then there is no callback, and the client simply displays the received data.
